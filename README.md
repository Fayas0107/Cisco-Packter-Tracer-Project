# Cisco-Packter-Tracer-Project
This project showcases a network topology designed using various Cisco technologies and configurations. 
It includes multiple network setups, demonstrating the integration of different VLANs, routing protocols (such as OSPF and EIGRP), and security features like access control lists (ACLs).
The project aims to simulate and optimize network performance across different segments, including LAN and WAN environments.
**VLAN Configuration:** Separation of network traffic for better security and performance.
**Routing Protocols:** Implementation of static and dynamic routing (RIP, OSPF) for efficient data forwarding across networks.
**Inter-VLAN Routing:** Demonstrating communication between different VLANs.**
**Trunking :** Aggregation of multiple interfaces for bandwidth optimization.
Packet Tracer simulation files and network configuration scripts.
